**Objective:** Introduce students to the world of generative AI and enable them to collaborate and produce a short video narrative using AI tools.

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Outline:**

## **Introduction to Generative AI (10 minutes)**

Brief overview of AI and Generative AI

Real-world applications and implications

Showcase examples of generative artworks, music, stories, etc.

## **Getting Started with Tools & Resources (10 minutes)**

Introduction to relevant online tools for the workshop:
 - Runway, DALL-E for generating images
 - OpenAI's ChatGPT for narrative
 - NaturalReader, Descript or Google's Text-to-Speech for voiceovers
 - Mubert, Jukebox for music generation
 - Veed.io for video editing, text to speech, subtitles

A quick demo of how to use these tools

## **Group Formation and Task Assignment (5 minutes)**

**Step 1 Form groups**

- Divide students into groups of 4-5. (Individual work is also possible.)

- [Optionally] Each student will be given a role: Narrator (in charge of the storyline), Visual Artist (in charge of photos and visual elements), Sound Engineer (in charge of background music), Voice Talent (in charge of voice-over), and Director (to oversee the entire project and make sure everything aligns).

- Obtain a group number from lecturer.

Refer to this online workbook, of your specifically assigned group number, for collabration and step-by-step guide.

## **Hands-On AI Generation: Multi-Media Story Telling (30 minutes)**

**Step 2 Define themes for the workshop**

- The group discusses and sets one or two high-level theme(s) for their story based on the photos. (Alternatively, can let AI to decide the theme using image to text techniques.)

- Each group writes a short description based on their theme, which will be used for AI to generate a story later.

**Step 3 Collect relevant photos**

- Each student contributes 2-3 photos, relevant to the themes.

**Step 4 Shortlist the photos for use, rename files by order**

**Step 5 Use AI to automatically generate textual description of given image**

- **Image Description Generation:** All team members uses Image Captioning or a similar tool to generate one-line description of each image. Review and optimize the image description.

**Step 6 Create a prompt to generate storyline using AIGC Large Language Model**

- **Narrative/Story Generation:** The Narrator uses ChatGPT or a similar tool to elaborate on the story using a suitable **prompt**.

**Step 7 Use AI to automatically generate short video/images/music based on given image**

- **[Optional] Visual Element (image/video) Creation:** The Visual Artist utilizes RunWay, DALL-E or a similar platform to generate visuals based on the group's photos.

- **[Optional] Music Creation:** The Sound Engineer uses Mubert, Jukebox or a similar tool to produce background music based on a text prompt or mood of the story.

- **[Optional] Voice-over Creation:** The Voice Talent employs NaturalReader, Descript or Google's Text-to-Speech to generate the voiceover.

**Step 8 Use video editing tool to integrate all media resources**

- **Assemble a Video:** Use a video editing tool, Veed.io, Canva or other online platform, the Director and team can integrate the AI-generated story, visuals (images/videos), voiceover, subtitles, and background music to form a 1-2 minutes short video.

## **Presentation & Voting (5 minutes)**

Each group presents their short video.

Students vote (excluding their own group) on various categories like Best Story, Best Visuals, Best Sound, etc. (Use tools like PigeonHole, Mentimeter for live voting)
